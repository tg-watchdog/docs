# Version 2208.01

## Release Date
22nd August 2022

## Update in Bot Program
- Здравствуйте! Telegram Watchdog now supports Russian localisation. Telegram Watchdog can now say hello in Russian when your OS or Telegram app is being set as the Russian language.

## Known Issues
- It is may possible that the fallback language is wrongly set as Simplified Chinese when you use language settings not supported by Telegram Watchdog (US English is expected). It may be the issue caused by the grammY library, and we will contact the grammY development team for a diagnosis.
