Actually, you don’t need to fully understand the content in this part to use Telegram Watchdog – you can now use Telegram Watchdog by using the pre-build bot.

However, we still think that the content in this part is necessary: for one side, some users hope to deploy Telegram Watchdog by themselves (and we hope that you can share your Telegram Watchdog instance to public) and there are some technological details needs to be known in deploy process; for another side, we hope to clarify that how Telegram Watchdog works, and we believe that the explanation can provide a dive in chance to somebody want to know or contribute to Telegram Watchdog.

The contents in this part are not static – it will be updated sometime. Remember to come back and check out new stuff!
