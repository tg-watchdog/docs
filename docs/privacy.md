# Privacy Policy & Statements
Thank you for using Telegram Watchdog!

We respect and care about your privacies, which we put first place when designing and developing Telegram Watchdog. In this document, we will discuss how Telegram Watchdog processes your data, and we hope it can help you to understand how your data is being processed.

## What data will we collect?
Telegram Watchdog is a CAPTCHA verify bot, as you know. To complete the CAPTCHA process, we need to know who you are and ensure you are not using automatic programs according to your behaviour data.

The data we will collect when in the CAPTCHA process (and why) are listed below:

- Your Telegram account public information, including but not limited to your unique ID, username, full name and avatar. It can help us to identify different users to contact you directly, mark CAPTCHA results, and make sure the CAPTCHA request is sent from Telegram but not other ways.
- Your CAPTCHA result ticket. Our CAPTCHA carrier is Friendly Captcha, which will observe your behaviour, issue verification results and help us to complete CAPTCHA verification. [Click here](https://friendlycaptcha.com/privacy/) to check out legal statements of information processing by Friendly Captcha.

Please remember that the information that Telegram Watchdog can fetch is the information you choose to be public in Telegram. Check your Telegram account's privacy settings if you want to hide that information from Telegram Watchdog, and it will not affect Telegram Watchdog. Please note that some data, like your first name or unique ID, cannot be set as private to Telegram Watchdog.

## Liar! Telegram says you will collect our IP address!
Calm down! This is a misleading statement by Telegram on some level.

Telegram Watchdog uses the Web App feature provided by Telegram, which allows bot developers to make their service webpages into native-like GUI and provide with Telegram bot platform.

It is no different than you accessing a website with a web browser or in a Web App provided by a bot because they use the same fundamental technologies, which require you to send your IP address to reply to your web requests.

Telegram Watchdog will not collect, process and store your IP address and other information not mentioned in the last section. The IP address will process for network processing and transferring and will not be applied to Telegram Watchdog.

Please note that that statement is subject to the Telegram Watchdog algorithm, which excludes the code from Friendly Captcha. You can check out the legal privacy statements for Friendly Captcha [here](https://friendlycaptcha.com/privacy/).

## What data will we store?
Nothing! Also known as we will not store your data.

In the algorithm designing stage, we choose a stateless structure (no database and other data storage ways), which means we intend not to store your data on our server.

## Any problem?

These documents may be changed anytime; the last publish date is 19 September 2022. Even we will make it possible to let you know the changes to this document; you should check this page frequently for any possible changes.

Please note that this privacy policy statement will only be subject to the code of Telegram Watchdog and the official and primary Telegram Watchdog bot (https://t.me/WatchdogVerifyBot). Any other third-party Telegram Watchdog instances will not be subject to these documents. If you are using a third-party instance, please read the privacy-related documents related to the instance.
